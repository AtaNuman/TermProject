This is a game based of the phone game Monument Valley. It uses 3D coordinates to plot a 2D graph, and based on what side of the box youâ€™re looking at, the coordinates used to make the 2D board changes. No third party libraries were used, other than tkinter. Simply by running the file on Sublime or any other text editor, the game should run. No additional files are needed.
